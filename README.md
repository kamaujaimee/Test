# News app designed by use of Android Architecture Guidelines and Kotlin. 
# Has a simple splash screen, source list, news list and custom webview for the news details.
# Uses a few dependencies to give it a cool look.
# The code is customizable.
# How it works
#  1. Loads an array of list of news sources from a news api (www.ewsapi.org)
#  2. Displays them using a well structured recycler view.
#  3. Has click listener that loads the specific news list into a list.
#  4. Finally it loads each selected news into a custome webview.
